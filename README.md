# ChoreTracker

## "Who's turn is it to take out the trash?"
Sound familiar? Household chores need to be done, and while taking turns may seem like a good idea, it's hard to keep track of who's turn it is. This project is designed to solve that problem by tracking who's done a chore and who should do it next. Simply put in the people who should do chores, add chores and whenever they need to be done, check who's turn it is. If someone is gone or busy, skip them and their turn is pushed back. 

**Step 1: Add Users**
These people will do the chores.

Delete and add as needed until all the names are in the list.

**Step 2: Add Chores**
These are the chores to track so you can check to see who's turn it is.

You may select which users need to do this chore. It will be automatically set to all users.

**Step 3: Check the Next User**
The next time the chore must be done, open it up and see who's next. If they do the chore hit the "Complete" button, but if they are unable to do it at the moment hit the "Skip User" button to come back to them later.

You may edit and delete chores as needed.
